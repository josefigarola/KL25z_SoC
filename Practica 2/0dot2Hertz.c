/* Toggling blue LED using TPM0 delay
* This program uses TPM0 to generate long delay to
* toggle the blue LED.

* MCGIRCLK (32.768 kHz) is used as timer counter clock.

* Prescaler is set to divided by 4 and the Modulo register
* is set to 40,959. The timer counter overflows at
* 32,768 Hz / 40,960 / 4 = 0.2 Hz
*
* The blue LED is connected to PTD1.
