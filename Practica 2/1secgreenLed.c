/* Toggling green LED using SysTick delay

* This program uses SysTick to generate one second delay to  toggle the green LED.

* System clock is running at 41.94 MHz. SysTick is configure to count down from 41939 to give a 1 ms 
delay.

For every 1000 delays (1 ms * 1000 = 1 sec), toggle the green LED once. The green LED is connected to PTB19.
